# Chicago-Restaurant-Clustering

• The project explores restaurants in Chicago and clusters them based on their location. This helps to classify the city into different zones (neighborhoods) and compare metrics such as average rating, average risk and the size of the clusters.<br>
• The project is aimed to help customers or tourists in Chicago find the most dominant area for a specified cuisine to dine out.<br>
• It can also act as an aid to new restaurateurs to explore the city to find localities where their restaurant is likely to be profitable. This is done by further analyzing the clusters to obtain information that can help identify areas with high competition or low interest for a particular cuisine.<br>
• Extracted and collected data from Yelp Fusion API, Google Maps API, and the Chicago Food Inspection Dataset.<br>
• Integrated all the datasets using similarity matching and cleaned all the datasets to produce the final dataset.<br>
• Performed EDA to visualize the trends in the data and understand it better.<br>
• Trained and tested various clustering models like K-Means, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, OPTICS, to cluster the restaurants based on geospatial data (geographical coordinates).<br>
• Assigned a neighborhood to each cluster and performed Analyzed the clusters to suggest clusters to users based on food preferences, or potential restaurateurs planning to open a new restaurant in Chicago, based on cuisine, competition, business failure rate, etc.
